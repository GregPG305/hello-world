# hello-world
My first repository in GitHub :)

Hi Everyone!

I'm Gregorio. I'm new at using GitHub, but I'm really excited to start coding and to learn more in this huge community. 
I'm from Mexico City. I usually spend my free time reading, listening to Alternative or R&B music, or watching Sci-Fic movies. 

Let the journey begin!!
